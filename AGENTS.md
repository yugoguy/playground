1. Keep code as organized and simple and minimal as possible.
2. Follow the instruction correctly. never so what is not asked, and if you really feel a change in that part then explicitly ask the user whether you should do seomthing with it with reason.
3. when building a class or functions, it is not favorable to have certain parameters or hyperparameters are only set by default, not allowing the users to change it by controling the arguments of the functions or classes.
4. especially for the classes, it should be organized in hierarchical fasion, so that the later development and change can be more systematic.
5. the function should be as general as possible, so that it could be used by changing the argument even when the changes in some other parts are made.
